# Onboarding the Community into ProximaX Sirius TESTNET

This readme contains the official ProximaX instructions on how to use the community distribution for a Sirius Blockchain Peer.  The deployable Peer automatically hooks-up to ProximaX MAINNET, provided you setup the validator key (harvestKey).



## Methods of Onboarding:
---

There are two main ways to use the distribution:
1. - [Vagrant Box](https://github.com/proximax-storage/community-testnet-onboarding/blob/master/vagrant-method/README.md)
2. - [docker-compose](https://github.com/proximax-storage/community-testnet-onboarding/blob/master/docker-method/README.md)

## Staking?


Stake is assigned to your Validator Key (harvestKey).

For creation of your own validator key (harvestKey), please follow wiki guide here:  [Create your own MAINNET Validator Key](https://github.com/proximax-storage/community-sirius-chain-onboarding/wiki/Create-your-MAINNET-Validator-Key-(harvestKey)-using-the-ProximaX-WALLET)
